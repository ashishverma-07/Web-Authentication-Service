After running npm init, kindly run the program using:
node options.js [ -t|--auth-time AUTH_TIME ] [ -d|--ssl-dir SSL_DIR ] PORT

The auth request creates an authentication token and passed in the body of the response. 
The authentication token should be copied manually and should be pasted for the subsequent get requests authorization bearer header.
